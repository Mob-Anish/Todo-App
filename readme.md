* This is a simple todo list application using vanilla javascript and the concept of local storage. 
* Here we can simply add some text or useful note which will be stored in the application.


## Local Storage

Local storage is useful for storing data on the browser as strings. It's a key-value based medium which allows us to set values with keys and get data by keys. Once they are saved, they will persist as long as we won't delete them.
