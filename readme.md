# Todo Application

This is a simple todo list application using vanilla javascript and the concept of local storage. Here we can simply add the text or some useful note which will be stored in the application.


## Local Storage

Local storage is useful for storing data on the browser as strings. It's a key-value based medium which allows us to set values with keys and get data by keys. Once they are saved, they wil persist as long as we won't delete them.
